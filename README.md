## Project Budget Estimate (MXN)

This is a conceptual budget for developing the ChefAI MVP over 3-4 months, adjusted for platform fees.

### 1. Net Development Goal

This is the amount needed to cover all development costs *after* fees.

-   **Development & Personnel Costs:** ~$455,000
-   **Infrastructure & Software:** ~$25,000
-   **Contingency Fund (15%):** ~$72,000
-   **Total Net Required:** **$552,000 MXN**

### 2. Kickstarter Funding Goal Calculation

To receive the net amount, the public funding goal must account for deductions.

-   **Platform Commission:** 5%
-   **Taxes & Processing Fees:** 24%
-   **Total Deductions:** 29%

**Formula:** `Net Goal / (1 - 0.29)`
`$552,000 / 0.71 = $777,465`

### **Adjusted Kickstarter Goal: $780,000 MXN**

*   **Total Raised:** **$780,000**
*   **Less 29% Fees:** `-$226,200`
*   **Net Funds for Project:** **$553,800 MXN**
